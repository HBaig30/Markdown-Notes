It's important for me to cite everything I learn here in order to prevent any sort of plagiarism. 
These notes are meant for my own use and if others wish to look through them to get a gist of what
each of these topics entail then I'm happy to share them. 

I am learning these topics through a Udacity course called "Intro to Machine Learning" taught by 
Sebastien and Katie. The link to the course is below:
