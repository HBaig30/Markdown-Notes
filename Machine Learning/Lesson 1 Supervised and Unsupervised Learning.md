<b>Lesson 1: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning </b>

<u>Supervised Classification:</u> Bunch of examples, where you know the correct example in order to determine the right behavior. ML algos view multiple datasets and will learn from these datasets

<u>Examples of Supervised Learning</u>

1. Given someone's music choices, and a bunch of features of that music, recommend a new song
2. From an album of tagged photos, recognize someone in a picture

<i>The key here is that there needs to be a sample set already for the algorithm to learn from it</i>

- <b>FROM</b> an album of tagged photos recognize someone in that picture, there has to be an existing album already 
- <b>GIVEN SOMEONES MUSIC CHOICES...</b> implies that there already exists a dataset filled with the persons music choices.

An example where supervised learning would not be possible is finding fraudulent behavior in bank transactions, what classifies as "fraudulent behavior" within an existing dataset? And how would you figure out that fraudulent behavior within that dataset when its not even defined? This is why fraudulent activity within bank transactions aren't classified as supervised learning

Another example is to cluster students based on their learning styles. We don't know what the types of students are and how many we are looking for

Both of these are examples of <u>unsupervised learning</u> and not <i> supervised learning</i>
